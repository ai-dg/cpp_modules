# 🚀 C++ Modules - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming

![Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-100%25-brightgreen)  
📌 **42 School - C++ Specialization Track**  

## 📝 Description
The **C++ Modules** series is a comprehensive deep dive into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, memory management, and advanced C++ features.  
The goal of these modules is to progressively introduce **polymorphism, operator overloading, exceptions, STL, and advanced templates** while strictly following **C++98** standards.

## 🔥 Key Concepts Covered
✅ **Memory Management & Pointers**  
✅ **Ad-hoc & Subtype Polymorphism**  
✅ **Operator Overloading**  
✅ **Exception Handling**  
✅ **Abstract Classes & Interfaces**  
✅ **Templates & STL (Standard Template Library)**  

## 🏆 Result: **100% Completion**
All **10 modules** were successfully completed, covering core and advanced C++ topics. 🎉

## 📂 **Modules Overview**
| 📌 Module | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Module 00** | Introduction to C++ - Namespaces, classes, member functions, and initialization lists |
| **Module 01** | Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and switch statements |
| **Module 02** | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Form |
| **Module 03** | Inheritance and class hierarchy |
| **Module 04** | Abstract classes, interfaces, and subtype polymorphism |
| **Module 05** | Exception handling and bureaucratic form processing |
| **Module 06** | Type conversion and C++ casting (`static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, `const_cast`) |
| **Module 07** | Function and class templates |
| **Module 08** | STL Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms |
| **Module 09** | Advanced STL - Bitcoin Exchange, Reverse Polish Notation, Merge Sorting |

## 📌 Example Implementations
### 🔹 **Module 02 - Operator Overloading**
- Implemented a **fixed-point arithmetic class** with overloaded operators.
- Ensured proper **copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor**.

### 🔹 **Module 04 - Polymorphism**
- Designed an **Animal hierarchy** using **abstract classes**.
- Implemented **virtual destructors** and **dynamic binding**.

### 🔹 **Module 08 - STL Algorithms**
- Created a **custom container manipulator**.
- Implemented **iterators, algorithms (`find`, `sort`)**, and **custom comparator functions**.

## 🚀 Compilation & Usage
### 🛠 **Compile a Module**
```sh
make
``` 

### ▶️ **Run an Example (e.g., Polymorphism)**
```sh
./polymorphism  
```
